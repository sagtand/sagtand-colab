Send customisable emails to your users for different WordPress notifications.

== Description ==

> New add-ons are now available! [Buy Add-ons](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/store/)

Better Notifications for WordPress allows you to generate custom email notifications and send them to user roles (including custom roles) or individual users for all kinds of things happening on your WordPress website. Emails are sent out via your WordPress website (using `wp_mail`) but can be sent via SMTP using an appropriate 3rd party plugin should you wish.

= For example: =
You want a user with the editor role (or all users using the Editor role) to be alerted via email when a new post is published and you'd like to customise it to include your branding along with the author's display name and post time - with this plugin, that's easy.

> DISCLAIMER
> This is an incredibly useful and highly rated plugin however, it's possible that overuse or abuse of this plugin could upset your users by sending them too many notifications. By downloading / installing / using this plugin, you take full responsibility of the management / quantity / types of notifications that are sent out from it including abiding by any SPAM laws in your country / operating areas, dealing with / responding to subscription / unsubscription requests, complaints, and so on. I accept no liability or responsibility for SPAM or abuse of this plugin from the user(s) of or anyone that may receive notifications as a result of the use of this plugin. I'm trusting you, please don't abuse your users.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'bnfw' plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory or install it via your WordPress Admin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the settings in the new 'Notifications' Menu item in the sidebar to configure the plugin.
4. (Optional) Install a plugin to use SMTP instead of `wp_mail()`. I recommend [Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/).
5. Test by creating a notification with some [shortcodes](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WordPress").



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are shortcodes? Where can I use them in this plugin? = 

Shortcodes are little blocks of content contained in square brackets. For example, if you want to add the content of a post to a notification for 'New Post Published', you can use the `[post_content]` shortcode to display this in the email that is sent out. 

Shortcodes can be used in the 'Subject' and 'Message Body' of your notifications, except for a select few (due to a restriction in WordPress).

> A handy list of shortcodes you can use is available [here](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WordPress").

= What are some scenarios this plugin could be used for? =

* Outreach: A blog/news site with hundreds of subscribers and want to use it to alert them of new blog posts. 
* Communication: A small, internal WordPress site and use it to alert staff of new posts or comments.
* Monitor: A website for an awesome new product or service and use it for notifications of pingbacks and trackbacks.
* Security: To receive alerts of password reset requests and their corresponding user.

The possibilities are endless! 

= Does this plugin work with Akismet? =

Yes! There is an option for suppressing comments marked as SPAM by Akismet in the plugin settings.

= Does this plugin work with Multisite? =

Yes and no - some notifications work, others don't, and some are missing entirely. I do plan on adding full Multisite support at a later date however, this will be in the form of an add-on. 

= What isn't this plugin? =

It's not designed to send out newsletters. There is no send-this-out-on-this-date style functionality included. There are many other great plugins available that you could use for that instead. Additionally, users cannot currently unsubscribe automatically from notifications so you'll have to work out how you manage unsubscribers manually.

= How do I set-up WordPress to work with this plugin correctly? =

This will very much depend on what notifications you're using the plugin for. Out-of-the-box, this plugin works very well but there are a few tweaks that you will need to ensure 100% compatibility. All the below points refer to this plugin: 

* If you want to use the new comment notifications in BNFW, you need to un-tick 'Email me whenever anyone posts a comment' and 'A comment is held for moderation' under Settings > Discussion. It's OK if you don't do this but you might receive WordPress's own email notifications along with the ones you've configure using BNFW. It also goes without saying that you need to enable comments for your posts if you want the email notifications to come through. 

* If you want to use the 'Comment Reply' transactional email, you need to ensure that comments are only set-up to be 2-levels deep. You can do this by going to Settings > Discussion and changing the option 'Enable threaded (nested) comments 'X' levels deep' to '2'. Please also ensure this option is ticked. 

= Notifications aren't coming through! =

First of all, follow [this article](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/how-can-i-receive-the-best-support/) about how to find out what might be causing the problem. Additionally, this [very handy answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/371/how-do-you-make-sure-email-you-send-programmatically-is-not-automatically-marked) on Stack Overflow explains what you might need to do to make sure that emails don't make it through to your users SPAM / Junk folders. It's worth going through this and completing as much as you can.

Many hosts place a limit on the number of emails that can be sent out within an hour so this may also cause some delay in emails arriving. Please check with your host to find out what this limit is. 

If you're still having problems, please drop me a line in the [Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw) and I'll do my best to help. 

= Some of my shortcodes aren't working! =

It's possible you're inserting a shortcode into a notification that cannot use it. For example: the 'New Category' email notification cannot use any of the author or time shortcodes as WordPress only stores the category name, category slug and category description in the database by default. It's also worth checking the spelling and underscores in any shortcodes as well as if they are wrapped in square brackets `[]`.

= I press the 'Send Me a Test Email' button but nothing happens! =

Check that you've saved your notification first, then try again. It may take a second for the email to come through. Please also check your email SPAM filter.

= Other emails from WordPress / other plugins are being messed up! =

WordPress, by default, sends all emails in Plain Text. If you'd like to include code or use the WYSIWYG editor as part of Better Notifications for WordPress in your emails, you can change this to HTML using the global setting in Better Notification for WordPress. This can be found under the 'Notifications > Settings' screen. Changing this global email format setting will affect how all emails are sent out from WordPress however, so you may experience formatting issues with emails sent out from other plugins if you change the email format setting in this way. If you do, change this setting to Plain Text. You can also set the email format on a per-notification basis when setting-up a new Notification. The caveat is that WordPress will only either allow setting the email format globally (for all emails) or individually for anything that's non-transactional.

= Custom Post Type 'X' isn't showing in the list of available custom post types =

This is most likely because it's `public` setting is set to `false`. Try changing this and see if it shows up in the list. If the custom post type has been created by a plugin and is set to private (such as [TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/ "TablePress")), you'll need to get in touch with the plugin author to see if they'll consider changing it to public instead so that BNFW can send out notifications for it. 

= I'm using the P2 theme and my notifications are coming through twice =

In order to fix a problem with P2 not triggering notifications at all, if you post from the WordPress Admin, it will trigger two notifications: one for the standard settings and one for the additional P2 settings. I recommend posting from the front-end only if you're using P2 in order to trigger just a single notification. 

= I'm using a theme and notifications aren't coming through =

Try adding this code to your functions.php in your theme / child theme directory and replace `theme_name` with the name of your theme and re-test. 

```
function bnfw_insert_post_hook_for_theme( $themes ) {
	$themes[] = 'theme_name';
	return $themes;
}
add_filter( 'bnfw_insert_post_themes', 'bnfw_insert_post_hook_for_theme' );
```

= Can I translate this plugin? =

Yes, of course! The plugin is completely translation-friendly and if you send me your .po file, I'll make sure to include it in the plugin and credit you on this page.

= Will this plugin work with versions of WordPress less than 3.5? = 

An older version might work but this is untested. A lot of the newer features require WordPress 4.0 and above.

* Improved: Reduced the flash of hidden elements when loading the New / Edit Notification screen.
* Fixed: WordPress 4.3 doesn't allow passwords to be automatically created for new users and will instead, send them to a password generator page. The `[password]` shortcode has been replaced with `[password_url]`. `[password]` should still work though so it won't break your existing notifications.
